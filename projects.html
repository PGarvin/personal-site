                    <p class="content__container__text">After watching the last few episodes of "Game Of Thrones," I reached out to other friends who had watched it so that we could commiserate. But I couldn't really say much other than just emojis. My friends didn't miss a beat, and knew exactly what I meant. I realized that I could sum up many of the show's shocking episodes with emojis. So, I thought I'd revisit some of the most iconic, memorable, or downright WTF-able episodes of the show. It was simple CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.</p>

                    <p class="content__container__text">In 2018, Boston Globe travel writer Christopher Muther asked his Facebook friends where in Boston they would take visitors. The responses confirmed a suspicion Muther had long held: the Boston that travel books portray is not the Boston that locals experience. Worse, Muther realized, the Boston that's sold to tourists is a flat amalgamation of cliches: clam chowdah, sports, and colonial history. Muther's essay on the topic could have just been put in a regular Globe article page, but I thought something this witty and potentially divisive could make a splash on our website. I started thinking of all the visual shorthands for Boston that I could think of, and I realized we could use those in a tongue-in-cheek presentation. I decided to take Muther's best snark to put in pulled quotes done in the colors and fonts of iconic Boston brands. Some brands will be recognizable to people who have never been to New England. Others were Easter eggs for more seasoned locals. The "Cliche Boston" logo lets readers know the basic gist and tone of the story right away, as it is modeled after a certain watering hole where everyone is supposed to know your name. For readers who want to dig deeper into the story, there are plenty of hidden references.</p>

                    <p class="content__container__text">At the end of 2018, Boston Globe travel writer Christopher Muther had an interesting idea on how to preview 2019. "Overtourism" had been a problem for several destinations in 2018, so Muther had the idea of giving people some alternatives to the well-worn places that were trying to curb the number of visitors. He picked six locations around the globe and offered an alternative destination based on what type of vacation you wanted. Design director Heather Hopp-Bruce and I came up with the idea of using vintage postcards as a unifying theme throughout the online package. I tried to emulate the goofiest and tackiest postcards I could find. To his credit, Muther was helpful in suggesting corny puns and taglines for each postcard. </p>

                    <p class="content__container__text">Boston Globe reporters Todd Wallack and Billy Baker wrote a quirky story using RMV data on the types of cars owned by people in Massachusetts. I took Todd's data and created a few JSON arrays that I then used as the base for two maps and several bar charts. I coded the charts and the dropdowns with JavaScript and D3, though the most fun part of it was the animated SVGs of the cars. The data set was interesting, but had the potential to overwhelm, so I wanted to simplify it and break it up into digestible chunks based on what the readers themselves might want to know about the car they drive or the town where they live. Even then, the data could be dry, so I added the animated cars to give the overall piece a whimsical feel.</p>

                    <p class="content__container__text">In November 2018, Massachusetts voters got to decide whether to keep or repeal the state's transgender antidiscrimination law. The law, enacted in 2016 and signed into law by Governor Charlie Baker, added gender identity to the list of reasons people can't be discriminated against in public spaces. Reporter Stephanie Ebbert had covered the law and the efforts to repeal it. Taking her previous articles, I compiled a primer about the ballot measure and the law it targeted. We could have easily done this as a bulleted list with subheads, or even as a simple Q-&-A. Taking inspiration from a Washington Post package about marijuana, I presented this information as a quiz so as to be more engaging for readers. It's not a quiz that "keeps score" or tells you how many you got right or wrong, because the goal was not to "get them all right." The goal here was to encourage readers to read the entire package because there was a lot at stake here, as lives would be impacted no matter how the vote turned out. Mindful of the fact that much of the public discourse on this ballot measure had been reduced to discussion of bathrooms, I carefully picked the images and flow of the questions to better represent the totality of the issues at hand.</p>

I renewed my interest after some Globe colleagues and I checked out an arcade bar that had recently opened. With those old-school, 8-bit graphics fresh in my mind, I went to work the next day and found inspiration in the Boston practice of using household objects to save parking spaces after a snowstorm. People take the practice extremely seriously, and people who take parking spots that had a space saver have returned to their car to find nasty notes and in come cases, their cars vandalized. Using Javascript and jQuery, I put together this game and aimed for a mid-1980s Nintendo vibe.</p>

It's the 10th baseball championship for the city of Boston if you count the 1903 championship in which the Boston Americans beat the Pittsburgh Pirates. Using data I had previously compiled for a graphic about Boston's relationship with St. Louis, I compiled a database of all the winners of championships in the NBA, MLB, NFL, and NHL. It allowed Bostonians to brag on their teams, but also drew in fans of teams from other cities. Just a few months later, I was able to update this when the Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams in the Super Bowl. This evergreen project can be resurrected any time there's a Boston team in a championship, which seems to happen a lot. It's easy to update, as the real work is done by the code itself. All I have to do is update the JSON with who played who in a championship game, and the code calculates how many championships each team has won without me having to redo that work.</p>

                    <p class="content__container__text">When President Obama publicly endorsed same-sex marriage, the Globe ran a map showing state policies on gay marriage and a brief timeline of the issue. We re-ran those graphics when the Supreme Court ruled on the Defense of Marriage Act and Proposition 8. I wanted to create a more detailed timeline, though, showing how that map changed over time. The day after the Supreme Court's decisions, I began researching every constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, compiling a spreadsheet that with jQuery and JSON would become the eventual web graphic. The finished product is a map/timeline data visualization that we can update as more news breaks. This ran as a related link to almost every story about same-sex marriage that appeared on BostonGlobe.com, whether it was written by Boston Globe staff or a wire story. It functions as an aggregate source of coverage on the topic, while also doing what few other sites had done: showing the history of the same-sex marriage debate in the United States, both on state and national levels. Users can see how the fight for same-sex marriage unfolded in their state, but they can also choose to see the overall US history. As users scroll through the US timeline, the maps change, showing how the legality of same-sex marriage changed often. This is something that could be simply shown in a timeline, but the scroll-activated tally helps hammer home the point that this was an ever-present story with the tally changing sometimes daily.</p>

                    <p class="content__container__text">Derrick Rossignol looked up 31 years of Billboard Hot 100 data to determine whether our collective music tastes were cyclical or evolving. His impetus was a quote from Gene Simmons, who said rap would die off within the coming years. Derrick found that rap was actually more popular in the last few years than it had been previously. Derrick pitched this idea to Ideas editor Katie Kingsbury, who then consulted Heather Hopp-Bruce, who designed the Ideas section. They wanted to show the data, but in a fun way that wouldn't be daunting or clinically sterile. Heather knew I had a soft spot for pop culture, so she came to me. The thing that immediate struck me about the list was that many of the songs on the list elicited a visceral reaction. I kept getting distracted by the list of songs, because I wanted to look up the songs on YouTube. I thought our readers might be the same way, so I suggested we incorporate the YouTube links so that users could watch the videos for each of these songs. With the help of intern Stephanie Redding, I compiled 3,100 YouTube links into a spreadsheet. Derrick categorized the genres of each song. I then wrote some Javascript and jQuery that allowed users to sort each year's songs by genre or by Hot 100 ranking. Additionally, they could click on each song to see the video.</p>

After pitching it to Boston Globe AME for Design Dan Zedek, I got paired with Steve Heuser in the Ideas section. Using the archetypes described in Joseph Campbell's "The Hero With a Thousand Faces," the chart compares characters from the Harry Potter series, "Star Wars," "The Matrix," "Lord Of The Rings" and... "Finding Nemo." It was a fun and fresh approach to "Harry Potter" at a time when many outlets were focusing on the movie itself without digging much deeper into what the movie might mean in a cultural context.</p>

Based on that, I was asked to create their faces out of their lyrics. To achieve this, I ran their faces through a few Photoshop and Illustrator filters. Then, with that on a locked layer, I drew shapes for shadows, eyes, noses, and so on. Once I had those guidelines, meticulously picked out lyrics to fill those shapes, ultimately deleting the guide layers.</p>

                    <p class="content__container__text">Florida Times-Union health reporter wanted to point out medical technologies that made the region a leader in the Southeast. Editors and I felt we could work with him to show this in an alternative story format. I visited most of the facilities he mentioned, and then helped the reporter rewrite the text in bullet form.
